# Workshops

## Women Who Code Data Science

I collaborated with the amazing team at WWC Data Science to put together a workshop on creating visualizations in R. The workshop was geared to first-time users and ranged from covering basic R concepts to specific functions for tidyverse packages, such as dplyr and ggplot2. By the end of the session, participants created two visualizations - a faceted bar plot and a density plot.
